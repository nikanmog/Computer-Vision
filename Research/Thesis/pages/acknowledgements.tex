First of all, I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support that enabled me to pursue this degree. Without their help I would not have had many of the opportunities that got me where I am today.\\
In addition to that I would like to express my deepest sense of gratitude to my advisor Sina Shafaei. His continuous advice and consultations allowed me to avoid many common mistakes and significantly improve the quality of my work.\\
I would also like to thank the Microsoft Corporation for providing me with valuable cloud resources to train my models and the Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems for making my research possible.\\
