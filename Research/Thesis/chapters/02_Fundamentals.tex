%Terms and Definitions: Defines the fundamental concepts your thesis builds on. Your thesis implements a new type of parser generator and uses the term non-terminal symbol a lot? Here is where you define what you mean by it. The key to this chapter is to keep it very, very short. Whenever you can, donâ€™t reinvent a description for an established concept, but reference a text book or paper instead.
%If a reader cares enough about your topic to read your thesis, he probably knows the terms anyway. The chapter thus mostly serves to disambiguate overloaded terms and as a collection of pointers to more detailed sources for novice readers.
