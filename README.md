# Real Time Multi Face Emotion Recognition for Embedded Devices
This project contains an emotion recognition system designed for an embedded device like the Raspberry PI 3. The code will also run on any other Windows or Linux device.
Documentation, a scientific report, research notes as well as all the code for the data transformation pipeline and the code used to train the underlying CNN are also included.

### Project Structure
* Organization
	* This folder contains the proposal, organisational documents from the university (citation guide, how to write a good thesis, thesis examples) as well as the name change request.
* Research
	* This folder contains everything related to the final written thesis including the final [Thesis PDF](Research/Thesis.pdf), the LaTeX documents used to build the thesis, PDF versions of papers mentioned in the 'Related Work' section, my handwritten research notes and other documents used to document my research as well as all diagrams (.vsdx) and the expose. The Citavi files used for research and information management are also included.
* Training
	* This folder contains all files that were used in the process of model training including the final model as well as the Jupyter notebook used for the data transformation pipeline. 
	Please see the folders [README file](Training/README.md) for a more thorough documentation.
* Implementation
	* This folder contains the final implementation as well as all models and the analytics framework (including the SQLite database). Additionally all implementations used for benchmarking and the benchmark output (quantitative data and link to recordings) are included. 
		Please see the folder's [README file](Implementation/README.md) for a more thorough documentation.
